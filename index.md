# Topic Sentence Extraction

## Introduction
Topic sentence is one of the crucial parts for readers in article reading for many reasons. It summarizes the main idea of a body paragraph to show the big picture of a writer's idea to readers. Other than being a mere summary, topic sentence also serves as a sub-thesis of an article which is general enough to cover the support in the rest of body paragraph while being more direct than the thesis of the whole article[1]. Hence, finding a way to summarize the paragraph with a grammatical sentence will be very helpful for readers to recognize the main idea much easier in a short period of time.

Our goal is to build a topic sentence generation tool.
