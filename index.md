## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/TopicSentenceExtraction/TopicSentenceExtraction/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TopicSentenceExtraction/TopicSentenceExtraction/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# Topic Sentence Extraction

## Objective
Topic sentence is one of the crucial parts for readers in article reading for many reasons. It extracts the main idea of each paragraph in a paper and combines them into one sentence that relates to the main idea of the whole article. Although title is one of the key parts to understanding the main topic of an article, it may not exist in some situations such as comments and forum answers. In these cases, building a topic sentence generator will help readers recognize the main idea much easier in a short period of time.

The major functionality of our blueprint is topic extraction and sentence generation. First, this tool will extract a few topic keywords from an English paragraph or document given by users. Then it will generate a grammatical sentence by using the given keywords which is the key difference compared with those popular topic modeling online platforms which only return topic keywords to users.
