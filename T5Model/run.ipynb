sections at Tevatron and LHC energies\n","\n","Abstract: A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark, gluon-quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron Collider . Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious selection of events.\n","Ref: Phys.Rev.D76:013009,2007\n","-------------------------------------\n","INFO:numexpr.utils:NumExpr defaulting to 2 threads.\n","Function [getpaper] run time is 42.11s\n","(14298, 2) (3574, 2)\n","---------------------------------------\n","testing started\n","3574\n","random seed is 884\n","collecting test inputs: 100% 1000/1000 [00:00<00:00, 6432.52it/s]\n","Generating outputs:   0% 0/125 [00:00<?, ?it/s]/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:3226: FutureWarning: `prepare_seq2seq_batch` is deprecated and will be removed in version 5 of 🤗 Transformers.

All next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark, gluon-quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron Collider . Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious selection of events.\n","Ref: Phys.Rev.D76:013009,2007\n","-------------------------------------\n","INFO:numexpr.utils:NumExpr defaulting to 2 threads.\n","Function [getpaper] run time is 33.84s\n","(14298, 2) (1787, 2)\n","INFO:simpletransformers.t5.t5_utils: Creating features from dataset file at cache_dir/\n","  0% 0/14298 [00:00<?, ?it/s]/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:3226: FutureWarning: `prepare_seq2seq_batch` is deprecated and will be removed in version 5 of 🤗 Transformers.

All next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark, gluon-quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron Collider . Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious selection of events.\n","Ref: Phys.Rev.D76:013009,2007\n","-------------------------------------\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["INFO:numexpr.utils:NumExpr defaulting to 2 threads.\n"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["Function [getpaper] run time is 49.88s\n","(14298, 2) (3574, 2)\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["INFO:filelock:Lock 139903400093968 acquired on /root/.cache/huggingface/transformers/fe501e8fd6425b8ec93df37767fcce78ce626e34cc5edc859c662350cf712e41.406701565c0afd9899544c1cb8b93185a76f00b31e5ce7f6e18bbaef02241985.lock\n"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"f96f3605ce6d42a3b0b9649b191a4930","version_minor":0,"version_major":2},"text/plain":["Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/1.20k [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["INFO:filelock:Lock 139903400093968 released on /root/.cache/huggingface/transformers/fe501e8fd6425b8ec93df37767fcce78ce626e34cc5edc859c662350cf712e41.406701565c0afd9899544c1cb8b93185a76f00b31e5ce7f6e18bbaef02241985.lock\n","INFO:filelock:Lock 139903415510352 acquired on /root/.cache/huggingface/transformers/fee5a3a0ae379232608b6eed45d2d7a0d2966b9683728838412caccc41b4b0ed.ddacdc89ec88482db20c676f0861a336f3d0409f94748c209847b49529d73885.lock\n"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"fe77f51bf9dd42d3b16f4e493627d1e7","version_minor":0,"version_major":2},"text/plain":["Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/242M [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["INFO:filelock:Lock 139903415510352 released on /root/.cache/huggingface/transformers/fee5a3a0ae379232608b6eed45d2d7a0d2966b9683728838412caccc41b4b0ed.ddacdc89ec88482db20c676f0861a336f3d0409f94748c209847b49529d73885.lock\n","INFO:filelock:Lock 139903423637456 acquired on /root/.cache/huggingface/transformers/65fc04e21f45f61430aea0c4fedffac16a4d20d78b8e6601d8d996ebefefecd2.3b69006860e7b5d0a63ffdddc01ddcd6b7c318a6f4fd793596552c741734c62d.lock\n"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"a1919a4901d9448b9db8debcb0e551a3","version_minor":0,"version_major":2},"text/plain":["Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/792k [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["INFO:filelock:Lock 139903423637456 released on /root/.cache/huggingface/transformers/65fc04e21f45f61430aea0c4fedffac16a4d20d78b8e6601d8d996ebefefecd2.3b69006860e7b5d0a63ffdddc01ddcd6b7c318a6f4fd793596552c741734c62d.lock\n","INFO:filelock:Lock 139903232784912 acquired on /root/.cache/huggingface/transformers/06779097c78e12f47ef67ecb728810c2ae757ee0a9efe9390c6419783d99382d.8627f1bd5d270a9fd2e5a51c8bec3223896587cc3cfe13edeabb0992ab43c529.lock\n"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"11bd11823c67496f8be5dd4f44b44e2e","version_minor":0,"version_major":2},"text/plain":["Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/1.39M [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["INFO:filelock:Lock 139903232784912 released on /root/.cache/huggingface/transformers/06779097c78e12f47ef67ecb728810c2ae757ee0a9efe9390c6419783d99382d.8627f1bd5d270a9fd2e5a51c8bec3223896587cc3cfe13edeabb0992ab43c529.lock\n"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["---------------------------------------\n","testing started\n","random seed is 319\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"3d1b18d5050e438fa3eb64b1badce334","version_minor":0,"version_major":2},"text/plain":["Generating outputs:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:3226: FutureWarning: `prepare_seq2seq_batch` is deprecated and will be removed in version 5 of 🤗 Transformers.
