In the first method, analytically derived force distributions for slip bonds, slip-ideal bonds, and catch bonds are used to fit the cumulative distributions of the unbinding forces.

On the other hand, the numerical resolution of OT problems using entropic regularization has given rise to many applications, but because there are no known closed-form solutions for entropic regularized OT problems, these approaches are mostly algorithmic, not informed by elegant closed forms. In this paper, we propose to fill the void at the intersection between these two schools of thought in OT by proving that the entropy-regularized optimal transport problem between two Gaussian measures admits a closed form. Contrary to the unregularized case, for which the explicit form is given by the Wasserstein-Bures distance, the closed form we obtain is differentiable everywhere, even for Gaussians with degenerate covariance matrices. We obtain this closed form solution by solving the fixed-point equation behind Sinkhorn's algorithm, the default method for computing entropic regularized OT. Remarkably, this approach extends to the generalized unbalanced case -- where Gaussian measures are scaled by positive constants. This extension leads to a closed form expression for unbalanced Gaussians as well, and highlights the mass transportation \/ destruction trade-off seen in unbalanced optimal transport. Moreover, in both settings, we show that the optimal transportation plans are Gaussians and provide analytical formulas of their parameters. These formulas constitute the first non-trivial closed forms for entropy-regularized optimal transport, thus providing a ground truth for the analysis of entropic OT and Sinkhorn's algorithm."},"7":{"predict_title":"previous paper analyzed the difficulties associated with the application of numerical methods to the approximate kernel for the","actual_title":"On the Application of Numerical Methods to Hallen's Equation: The Case of a Lossy Medium","actual_abstract":"summarize: A previous paper analyzed in detail the difficulties associated with the application of numerical methods to Hallen's integral equation with the approximate kernel for the case of a lossless surrounding medium.

Most of these trackers train a binary classifier to distinguish the target from its background. However, they suffer from two limitations. Firstly, these trackers cannot effectively handle significant appearance variations due to the limited number of positive samples. Secondly, there exists a significant imbalance of gradient contributions between easy and hard samples, where the easy samples usually dominate the computation of gradient. In this paper, we propose a robust tracking method via Statistical Positive sample generation and Gradient Aware learning to address the above two limitations. To enrich the diversity of positive samples, we present an effective and efficient statistical positive sample generation algorithm to generate positive samples in the feature space. Furthermore, to handle the issue of imbalance between easy and hard samples, we propose a gradient sensitive loss to harmonize the gradient contributions between easy and hard samples.

The adsorption energy difference between different atoms can be as large as 80 meV. In addition, we find that, due to the logarithmic van Hove singularities in the electronic density of states at energies close to the Dirac point, the adsorption energy of either electron or hole doped samples is substantially increased. We also find that the adsorption energy increases with the decrease of the rotated angle between the layers. Finally, the large zero point energy of the C-H bond suggests adsorption and desorption of atomic hydrogen and deuterium should behave differently."},"25":{"predict_title":"the approach relies on Monte Carlo Simulations of the fine-grained CDF equation","actual_title":"An Efficient Solver for Cumulative Density Function-based Solutions of Uncertain Kinematic Wave Models","actual_abstract":"summarize: We develop a numerical framework to implement the cumulative density function method for obtaining the probability distribution of the system state described by a kinematic wave model.

For the first model, the quantum advantages disappear when it comes to the optimization of this model. Therefore, we introduce a second quantum circuit model where embeddings of entities are generated from parameterized quantum gates acting on the pure quantum state. The benefit of the second method is that the quantum embeddings can be trained efficiently meanwhile preserving the quantum advantages.

Although a smaller line of work considers physical adversarial attacks, in all cases these involve manipulating the object of interest, e.g., putting a physical sticker on an object to misclassify it, or manufacturing an object specifically intended to be misclassified. In this work, we consider an alternative question: is it possible to fool deep classifiers, over all perceived objects of a certain type, by physically manipulating the camera itself? We show that by placing a carefully crafted and mainly-translucent sticker over the lens of a camera, one can create universal perturbations of the observed images that are inconspicuous, yet misclassify target objects as a different class. To accomplish this, we propose an iterative procedure for both updating the attack perturbation , and the threat model itself . For example, we show that we can achieve physically-realizable attacks that fool ImageNet classifiers in a targeted fashion 49.6% of the time.

CapsNets have been shown to be more robust than CNNs to affine transformations of inputs. However, there is still a huge gap between their performance on transformed inputs compared to untransformed versions. In this work, we first revisit the routing procedure by rolling its forward and backward passes.

Traditionally, Automatic Traffic Recorders are used to collect this hourly volume data. These large datasets are time series data characterized by long-term temporal dependencies and missing values. Regarding the temporal dependencies, all roadways are characterized by seasonal variations that can be weekly, monthly or yearly, depending on the cause of the variation. Regarding the missing data in a time-series sequence, traditional time series forecasting models perform poorly under the influence of seasonal variations. To address this limitation, robust, Recurrent Neural Network based, multi-step ahead forecasting models are developed for time-series in this study. The simple RNN, the Gated Recurrent Unit and the Long Short-Term Memory units are used to develop the model and evaluate its performance. Two approaches are used to address the missing value issue: masking and imputation, in conjunction with the RNN models. Six different imputation algorithms are then used to identify the best model. The analysis indicates that the LSTM model performs better than simple RNN and GRU models, and imputation performs better than masking to predict future traffic volume. Based on analysis using 92 ATRs, the LSTM-Median model is deemed the best model in all scenarios for hourly traffic volume and AADT prediction, with an average RMSE of 274 and MAPE of 18.91% for hourly traffic volume prediction and average RMSE of 824 and MAPE of 2.10% for AADT prediction."},"40":{"predict_title":"DFM rules are a list of recommended rules which aim to improve design margins for better","actual_title":"In Design DFM Rule Scoring and Fixing Method using ICV","actual_abstract":"summarize: As compared to DRC rules, DFM rules are a list of selected recommended rules which aim to improve the design margins for better manufacturability.

Our investigations of replicating metal hierarchical nanostructures show the capability of imprinting features as small as 8 nm, far smaller than the grain size of bulk metals. Most surprisingly, the prepared metal hierarchical nanostructures were found possessing perfect monocrystalline structures. These findings indicate that nanoimprinting of crystalline metals below Tm might be from lattice diffusion.

Recent research highlighted that useful forensic traces are also left in the video container structure, thus offering the opportunity to understand the life-cycle of a video file without looking at the media stream itself. In this paper we introduce a container-based method to identify the software used to perform a video manipulation and, in most cases, the operating system of the source device. As opposed to the state of the art, the proposed method is both efficient and effective and can also provide a simple explanation for its decisions. This is achieved by using a decision-tree-based classifier applied to a vectorial representation of the video container structure. We conducted an extensive validation on a dataset of 7000 video files including both software manipulated contents , and videos exchanged through social media platforms . This dataset has been made available to the research community. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 97.6% in distinguishing pristine from tampered videos and classifying the editing software, even when the video is cut without re-encoding or when it is downscaled to the size of a thumbnail. Furthermore, it is capable of correctly identifying the operating system of the source device for most of the tampered videos."},"48":{"predict_title":"the ZTF alert stream distribution and processing system uses open-source technologies developed in industry.","actual_title":"The Zwicky Transient Facility Alert Distribution System","actual_abstract":"summarize: The Zwicky Transient Facility survey generates real-time alerts for optical transients, variables, and moving objects discovered in its wide-field survey.

The technologies used in this system provide a number of advantages for the ZTF use case, including built-in replication, scalability, and stream rewind for the distribution mechanism; structured messages with strictly enforced schemas and dynamic typing for fast parsing; and a Python-based stream processing interface that is similar to batch for a familiar and user-friendly plug-in filter system, all in a modular, primarily containerized system.

It maximizes a lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the data.

Function of objects, however, has a comparatively small number of prototypes. Therefore, function-based classification of new objects could be a valuable tool for generic object recognition. Object functions are closely related to hand-object interactions during handling of a functional object; i.e., how the hand approaches the object, which parts of the object and contact the hand, and the shape of the hand during interaction. Hand-object interactions are helpful for modeling object functions. However, it is difficult to assign discrete labels to interactions because an object shape and grasping hand-postures intrinsically have continuous variations. To describe these interactions, we propose the interaction descriptor space which is acquired from unlabeled appearances of human hand-object interactions. By using interaction descriptors, we can numerically describe the relation between an object's appearance and its possible interaction with the hand. The model infers the quantitative state of the interaction from the object image alone. It also identifies the parts of objects designed for hand interactions such as grips and handles. We demonstrate that the proposed method can unsupervisedly generate interaction descriptors that make clusters corresponding to interaction types. And also we demonstrate that the model can infer possible hand-object interactions."},"53":{"predict_title":"entropic regularization is a method of computing entropic regularized OT","actual_title":"Entropic Optimal Transport between Unbalanced Gaussian Measures has a Closed Form","actual_abstract":"summarize: Although optimal transport problems admit closed form solutions in a very few notable cases, e.g. in 1D or between Gaussians, these closed forms have proved extremely fecund for practitioners to define tools inspired from the OT geometry. On the other hand, the numerical resolution of OT problems using entropic regularization has given rise to many applications, but because there are no known closed-form solutions for entropic regularized OT problems, these approaches are mostly algorithmic, not informed by elegant closed forms. In this paper, we propose to fill the void at the intersection between these two schools of thought in OT by proving that the entropy-regularized optimal transport problem between two Gaussian measures admits a closed form. Contrary to the unregularized case, for which the explicit form is given by the Wasserstein-Bures distance, the closed form we obtain is differentiable everywhere, even for Gaussians with degenerate covariance matrices. We obtain this closed form solution by solving the fixed-point equation behind Sinkhorn's algorithm, the default method for computing entropic regularized OT. Remarkably, this approach extends to the generalized unbalanced case -- where Gaussian measures are scaled by positive constants. This extension leads to a closed form expression for unbalanced Gaussians as well, and highlights the mass transportation \/ destruction trade-off seen in unbalanced optimal transport. Moreover, in both settings, we show that the optimal transportation plans are Gaussians and provide analytical formulas of their parameters. These formulas constitute the first non-trivial closed forms for entropy-regularized optimal transport, thus providing a ground truth for the analysis of entropic OT and Sinkhorn's algorithm."},"54":{"predict_title":"Let us know what you think about it!","actual_title":"The hit problem of five variables in the generic degree and its application","actual_abstract":"summarize: Let "},"55":{"predict_title":"efficient algorithm of solution is proposed. the algorithm can be easily adapted to circular or","actual_title":"An efficient algorithm of solution for the flow of generalized Newtonian fluid in channels of simple geometries","actual_abstract":"summarize: In this paper a problem of stationary flow of generalized Newtonian fluid in a thin channel is considered.

To address such cases, we introduce the use of deep generative models to iteratively approximate the simulator in local neighborhoods of the parameter space. We demonstrate that these local surrogates can be used to approximate the gradient of the simulator, and thus enable gradient-based optimization of simulator parameters. In cases where the dependence of the simulator on the parameter space is constrained to a low dimensional submanifold, we observe that our method attains minima faster than baseline methods, including Bayesian optimization, numerical optimization, and approaches using score function gradient estimators."},"62":{"predict_title":"the fractional derivative creates substantial difficulties compared with the case of a classical parabo","actual_title":"Regularity theory for time-fractional advection-diffusion-reaction equations","actual_abstract":"summarize: We investigate the behavior of the time derivatives of the solution to a linear time-fractional, advection-diffusion-reaction equation, allowing space- and time-dependent coefficients as well as initial data that may have low regularity.

It is critical that medical first responders are well trained to deal with emergencies more effectively. This would require real-time monitoring and feedback for each trainee. Therefore, we introduced a voice-based SA to augment the training process of medical first responders and enhance their performance in the field. The potential benefits of SAs include a reduction in training costs and enhanced monitoring mechanisms. Despite the increased usage of voice-based personal assistants in day-to-day life, the associated effects are commonly neglected for a study of human factors. Therefore, this paper focuses on performance analysis of the developed voice-based SA in emergency care provider training for a selected emergency treatment scenario.

We find, both theoretically and experimentally, that the short-wavelength buckled configuration is energetically favorable for growing membranes lying on liquid, while the global buckling shape is more preferable for suspended ones.

The message flow from the source to the receivers can be modeled as a tree-graph, called broadcast-tree. The problem of finding the minimum-power broadcast-tree is NP-complete. Unlike most of the existing centralized approaches, we propose a decentralized algorithm, based on a non-cooperative cost-sharing game. In this game, every receiving node, as a player, chooses another node of the network as its respective transmitting node for receiving the message. Consequently, a cost is assigned to the receiving node based on the power imposed on its chosen transmitting node. In our model, the total required power at a transmitting node consists of the transmit power and the circuitry power needed for communication hardware modules. We develop our algorithm using the marginal contribution cost-sharing scheme and show that the optimum broadcast-tree is always a Nash equilibrium of the game.

The automated generation of Japanese fonts is in high demand because a Japanese font requires over 1,000 characters. Unfortunately, professional typographers create most fonts, resulting in significant financial and time investments for font generation. The proposed method can be a great aid for font creation because designers do not need to create the majority of the characters for a new font. The proposed method uses strokes from given samples for font generation. The strokes, from which we construct characters, are extracted by exploiting a character skeleton dataset. This study makes three main contributions: a novel method of extracting strokes from characters, which is applicable to both standard fonts and their variations; a fully automated approach for constructing characters; and a selection method for sample characters. We demonstrate our proposed method by generating 2,965 characters in 47 fonts.

Specifically, we model the interaction between a polarising beamsplitter, that plays the role of a semi-permeable membrane, and two photon gases of non-orthogonal polarisation.

These gradients also cause thermodynamic stresses which can drive fluid flow. Fluid flow in turn advects the composition field, while thermal noise creates additional random fluxes that allow the system to explore its configuration space and move towards the Boltzmann distribution.

In this work a new family of ciphers, called wave ciphers, is introduced. In wave ciphers, round functions feature wave functions, which are vectorial Boolean functions obtained as the composition of non-invertible layers, where the confusion layer enlarges the message which returns to its original size after the diffusion layer is applied. This is motivated by the fact that relaxing the requirement that all the layers are invertible allows to consider more functions which are optimal with regard to non-linearity. In particular it allows to consider injective APN S-boxes. In order to guarantee efficient decryption we propose to use wave functions in Feistel Networks. With regard to security, the immunity from some group-theoretical attacks is investigated. In particular, it is shown how to avoid that the group generated by the round functions acts imprimitively, which represent a serious flaw for the cipher."},"81":{"predict_title":"the methodology of DNA-mediated computing is used to enrich decision theory. it is a","actual_title":"Programmable DNA-mediated decision maker","actual_abstract":"summarize: DNA-mediated computing is a novel technology that seeks to capitalize on the enormous informational capacity of DNA and has tremendous computational ability to compete with the current silicon-mediated computing, due to massive parallelism and unique characteristics inherent in DNA interaction.

We adapt the injectivity proof which uses variations through geodesics to recover the function and we improve this result when the manifold is simple and the function is constant on tiles with geodesic edges, showing that the Jacobi fields of these variations are sufficient. We give also explicit formulas for the values near the boundary. We finally study the stability of the reconstruction method."},"83":{"predict_title":"the AF lumped-parameter model was run to simulate resting and various exercise","actual_title":"A Computational Study on the Relation between Resting Heart Rate and Atrial Fibrillation Hemodynamics under Exercise","actual_abstract":"summarize: Aims. Clinical data indicating a heart rate target during rate control therapy for permanent atrial fibrillation and assessing its eventual relationship with reduced exercise tolerance are lacking. The present study aims at investigating the impact of resting HR on the hemodynamic response to exercise in permanent AF patients by means of a computational cardiovascular model. Methods. The AF lumped-parameter model was run to simulate resting and various exercise conditions , considering different resting HR . To compare relative variations of cardiovascular variables upon exertion, the variation comparative index - the absolute variation between the exercise and the resting values in SHR simulations referred to the absolute variation in HHR simulations -was calculated at each exercise grade . Results. Pulmonary venous pressure underwent a greater increase in HHR compared to SHR simulations , while for systemic arterial pressure the opposite is true . Conclusions. The computational findings suggest that a slower, with respect to a higher resting HR, might be preferable in permanent AF patients, since during exercise pulmonary venous pressure undergoes a slighter increase and systemic blood pressure reveals a more appropriate increase."},"84":{"predict_title":"hybrid MPI+threads programming is becoming an alternative to the traditional MPI everywhere'","actual_title":"Scalable Communication Endpoints for MPI+Threads Applications","actual_abstract":"summarize: Hybrid MPI+threads programming is gaining prominence as an alternative to the traditional MPI everywhere' model to better handle the disproportionate increase in the number of cores compared with other on-node resources. Current implementations of these two models represent the two extreme cases of communication resource sharing in modern MPI implementations. In the MPI-everywhere model, each MPI process has a dedicated set of communication resources , which is ideal for performance but is resource wasteful. With MPI+threads, current MPI implementations share a single communication endpoint for all threads, which is ideal for resource usage but is hurtful for performance. In this paper, we explore the tradeoff space between performance and communication resource usage in MPI+threads environments. We first demonstrate the two extreme cases---one where all threads share a single communication endpoint and another where each thread gets its own dedicated communication endpoint and showcase the inefficiencies in both these cases. Next, we perform a thorough analysis of the different levels of resource sharing in the context of Mellanox InfiniBand. Using the lessons learned from this analysis, we design an improved resource-sharing model to produce \\emph that can achieve the same performance as with dedicated communication resources per thread but using just a third of the resources."},"85":{"predict_title":"the computational chemistry mailing list reveals the tensions associated with software within the community","actual_title":"Only the Initiates Will Have the Secrets Revealed: Computational Chemists and the Openness of Scientific Software","actual_abstract":"summarize: Computational chemistry is a scientific field within which the computer is a pivotal element. This scientific community emerged in the 1980s and was involved with two major industries: the computer manufacturers and the pharmaceutical industry, the latter becoming a potential market for the former through molecular modeling software packages. We aim to address the difficult relationships between scientific modeling methods and the software implementing these methods throughout the 1990s. Developing, using, licensing, and distributing software leads to multiple tensions among the actors in intertwined academic and industrial contexts. The Computational Chemistry mailing List , created in 1991, constitutes a valuable corpus for revealing the tensions associated with software within the community. We analyze in detail two flame wars that exemplify these tensions. We conclude that models and software must be addressed together. Interrelations between both imply that openness in computational science is complex."},"86":{"predict_title":"delay differential equations model of leukemia is introduced. the model takes into account three","actual_title":"A Comparison Between the Stability Properties in a DDE Model for Leukemia and the Modified Fractional Counterpart","actual_abstract":"summarize: In this paper, a delay differential equations model of leukemia is introduced and its dynamical properties are investigated in comparison with the modified fractional-order system where the Caputo's derivative is used.

These conditions are expressed in terms of the elements of the system's matrix, as well as of the fractional order of the Caputo derivative. In this setting, we obtain a generalization of the well known Routh-Hurwitz conditions. These theoretical results are then applied to the analysis of a two-dimensional fractional-order Morris-Lecar neuronal model, focusing on stability and instability properties. This fractional order model is built up taking into account the dimensional consistency of the resulting system of differential equations. The occurrence of Hopf bifurcations is also discussed. Numerical simulations exemplify the theoretical results, revealing rich spiking behavior.

Meeker and Hong provided an extensive discussion of the opportunities and challenges in big data and reliability, and described engineering systems that can generate big data that can be used in reliability analysis. Meeker and Hong focused on large scale system operating and environment data , and provided examples on how to link such data as covariates to traditional reliability responses such as time to failure, time to recurrence of events, and degradation measurements. This paper intends to extend that discussion by focusing on how to use data with complicated structures to do reliability analysis. Such data types include high-dimensional sensor data, functional curve data, and image streams. We first provide a review of recent development in those directions, and then we provide a discussion on how analytical methods can be developed to tackle the challenging aspects that arise from the complexity feature of big data in reliability applications.

By measuring the displacement at multiple parts of the human body, pulse wave velocity can be estimated from the pulse transit time. This paper proposes a technique for signal separation using an antenna array, so that pulse wave propagation can be measured in a non-contact manner. The body displacements due to the pulse wave at different body parts are highly correlated, and cannot be accurately separated using techniques that assume independent or uncorrelated signals. The proposed method formulates the signal separation as an optimization problem, based on a mathematical model of the arterial pulse wave. The objective function in the optimization comprises four terms that are derived based on a small-displacement approximation, unimodal impulse response approximation, and a causality condition. The optimization process was implemented using a genetic algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experiments."},"93":{"predict_title":"body composition analysis is known to be associated with many diseases including diabetes, cancers and cardiovascular diseases","actual_title":"Automatic segmentation of CT images for ventral body composition analysis","actual_abstract":"summarize: Purpose: Body composition is known to be associated with many diseases including diabetes, cancers and cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we developed a fully automatic body tissue decomposition procedure to segment three major compartments that are related to body composition analysis - subcutaneous adipose tissue , visceral adipose tissue and muscle. Three additional compartments - the ventral cavity, lung and bones were also segmented during the segmentation process to assist segmentation of the major compartments. Methods: A convolutional neural network model with densely connected layers was developed to perform ventral cavity segmentation. An image processing workflow was developed to segment the ventral cavity in any patient's CT using the CNN model, then further segment the body tissue into multiple compartments using hysteresis thresholding followed by morphological operations. It is important to segment ventral cavity firstly to allow accurate separation of compartments with similar Hounsfield unit inside and outside the ventral cavity. Results: The ventral cavity segmentation CNN model was trained and tested with manually labelled ventral cavities in 60 CTs. Dice scores for ventral cavity segmentation were 0.966+\/-0.012. Tested on CT datasets with intravenous and oral contrast, the Dice scores were 0.96+\/-0.02, 0.94+\/-0.06, 0.96+\/-0.04, 0.95+\/-0.04 and 0.99+\/-0.01 for bone, VAT, SAT, muscle and lung, respectively.

In the light of broad evidence demonstrating the potential sub-optimality of ranking based feature selection by any criterion, we propose to extend this focus with an information theoretic learning driven feature transformation concept. Methods: We present a maximum mutual information linear transformation , and a nonlinear transformation framework derived by a general definition of the feature transformation learning problem. Empirical assessments are performed based on electroencephalographic data recorded during a four class motor imagery brain-computer interface task. Exploiting state-of-the-art methods for initial feature vector construction, we compare the proposed approaches with conventional feature selection based dimensionality reduction techniques which are widely used in brain interfaces. Furthermore, for the multi-class problem, we present and exploit a hierarchical graphical model based BCI decoding system. Results: Both binary and multi-class decoding analyses demonstrate significantly better performances with the proposed methods. Conclusion: Information theoretic feature transformations are capable of tackling potential confounders of conventional approaches in various settings. Significance: We argue that this concept provides significant insights to extend the focus on feature selection heuristics to a broader definition of feature transformation learning in brain interfaces."},"96":{"predict_title":"reservoir computing is a bio-inspired computing paradigm for processing time-dependent signals. it","actual_title":"Brain-inspired photonic signal processor for periodic pattern generation and chaotic system emulation","actual_abstract":"summarize: Reservoir computing is a bio-inspired computing paradigm for processing time-dependent signals. Its hardware implementations have received much attention because of their simplicity and remarkable performance on a series of benchmark tasks. In previous experiments the output was uncoupled from the system and in most cases simply computed offline on a post-processing computer. However, numerical investigations have shown that feeding the output back into the reservoir would open the possibility of long-horizon time series forecasting. Here we present a photonic reservoir computer with output feedback, and demonstrate its capacity to generate periodic time series and to emulate chaotic systems. We study in detail the effect of experimental noise on system performance. In the case of chaotic systems, this leads us to introduce several metrics, based on standard signal processing techniques, to evaluate the quality of the emulation. Our work significantly enlarges the range of tasks that can be solved by hardware reservoir computers, and therefore the range of applications they could potentially tackle. It also raises novel questions in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory."},"97":{"predict_title":"we propose a statistical non-linear model based on the photomultiplier tube","actual_title":"Statistical Non-linear Model, Achievable Rates and Signal Detection for Photon-level Photomultiplier Receiver","actual_abstract":"summarize: We characterize the practical receiver in a wide range of signal intensity for optical wireless communication, from discrete pulse regime to continuous waveform regime.

Subsequently, a threshold-based classifier is proposed to distinguish the PMT working regimes based on the non-linear model. Moreover, we derive the approximate performance of mean power detection with infinite sampling rate and finite over-sampling rate in the linear regime based on small dead time and central-limit theorem. We also fomulate a signal model in the non-linar regime. Furthermore, the performance of mean power detection and photon counting detection with maximum likelihood detection for different sampling rates is evaluated from both theoretical and numerical perspectives. We can conclude that the sample interval equivalent to dead time is a good choice, and lower sampling rate would significantly degrade the performance."},"98":{"predict_title":"a new method to interpret the method is presented in the paper.","actual_title":"Analyzing -rays of the Galactic Center with Deep Learning","actual_abstract":"summarize: We present a new method to interpret the "},"99":{"predict_title":"the attractive tail of the intermolecular interaction affects very weakly the structural properties of","actual_title":"Role of attractive forces in the relaxation dynamics of supercooled liquids","actual_abstract":"summarize: The attractive tail of the intermolecular interaction affects very weakly the structural properties of liquids, while it affects dramatically their dynamical ones.
